    <blockquote class="text-[1.1rem] italic leading-[1.7] text-heading border-l-[3px] border-accent pl-4 mb-6">A software architect in Calgary that lives on open-source software.</blockquote>
    <p class="text-[0.95rem] text-body mb-4">Currently working on a small team that is utilizing Python and JavaScript for full-stack development to solve problems for companies in the Oil &amp; Gas production industry internationally.</p>
    <p class="text-[0.95rem] text-body mb-4">I am always eager to use the most promising technology available. This website was built to accelerate my own understanding of <strong>Astro.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>. It was also my learning environment for dialing in a Neovim workflow.</p>
    <p class="text-[0.95rem] text-body mb-4">In my spare time I love to cook healthy and nutritious meals, dive deep into tech side projects, or get active in the outdoors.</p>
    <p class="text-[0.95rem] text-body mb-4">I am a <strong>type-one diabetic</strong>. I think what people don't understand about type-one diabetes is how serious it is and how hard it can be. I have had to figure out how to balance the things that can impact diabetes. My schedule, my activity, my insulin, what I eat, when I eat, to control blood glucose levels.</p>
    <p class="text-[0.95rem] text-body"><a href="https://www.tidepool.org/automated-insulin-dosing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidepool's Loop</a> application is an open-source do-it-yourself effort by a group of people who said &ldquo;we are not waiting for something better&rdquo;. The goal was to connect medical devices into a single platform to take in information about all aspects of your life. It has changed the way diabetes is managed now and in the future.</p>
